. Redirection:
ls > test.txt
cat test.txt

ls >> test.txt
cat test.txt

- searching spasswd in root dir which not allowed permission: redirect standard error
find / -name  passwd -print

- Now try to get permission which is import all files not allowed to access to error.txt file but print out the other on the screen
find / -name  passwd -print 2> error.txt

cat error.txt

2. Special File

- Redirect all the error to dev/null which you will never seen them again
find / -name  passwd -print 2> /dev/null


ls > /dev/null
ls > /dev/zero

dd if=/dev/zero of=zero.txt count=250

- print all zero:
xxd zero.txt | less

- to see the file:
ls -la zero.txt

- Generate random number
cat /dev/urandom

3. How to listing the files:
ls 
ls -la

ls -a
- Display different listing
ls -lah

4. Dot file
ls -la

- Do not display the files start with dot
ls .
- Display ......
ls ..

copy everything to the file named ls1 and than try to how to access or display what is in the file:
cp /bin/ls ls1
ls1 NOT WORKING

./ls1 

5. File permission:
. = current directory
.. = directory above (parent directory)

ls -la
first called Group =-rw
second called owner = r--
last called world r--
-rw-r--r--
r = read which is 4
w = write which is 2
x = execute which is 1

touch me
ls -la me
-rw-r--r-- me

chmod 744 me
ls -la me
-rwxr--r-- me 

chmod 662 me
ls -la me
-rw-rw--w-
rw = 6
w = 2
xw = 3
r-x = 5

chmode u+x me
ls -la
-rwxrw--w-

chmod g+x me
-rwxrwx-w-

chmod g-x me
-rwxrw--w-

6. File managemnet:
rm = Permenant remove no return
cd
pwd
mv me you
mv me ../
The promt command as you if you want to delete?
rm -i me 

7. Symbole of Links:
create a link to the file which will display for the user where is located example:
ln -s /etc/passwd passwd

ls -la passwd
passwd -> /etc/passwd
here we have set up the link to the file passwd to remove the link use:
rm passwd

ln ls.txt lslik.txt
ls -la lslink.txt
lslink.txt

ls lslink.txt
lslink.txt

ls ls.txt
ls.txt

now remove the link
rm ls.txt
display again
ls -la lslink.txt

display the file as red because has a link but it's broken

ln -s /var/www/ web
ls web
- if is display red that means the /var/www not exisit?

sudo mkdir /var/www
ls web 
display web -> /var/www/

8. Comperssion file:
- zip everyfile start with dilshad
zip dilshad.zip dilshad*

ls 
dilshad.zip
unzip dilshad.zip
tar means tab archaive
cf means create file
tar cf dil.tar dil*

- tar with coperssions
tar cfz dil.tar.gz dil*

tar cfzv dil.tar.gz dil*

extracting the above file
tar xfz dil.tar.gz

xfz = execute file zipped

tar xfzv dil.tar.zv

9. File System:
- bin: is a short for binary is where the program is live.
- etc: is where all configuration file for different system and util.
- boot: where the operating system is and all boot
- cdrom: is mount of the location for file system joing te file system into this folder.
- dev: is where all the devices are under linux every file get own device.
- home: home directory for all useres

- srv: place some peticular server
- sys: system data

- usr: all useres
- var: any varibale data like log directory which change a lot.

10. Path Variable: This where the system look for program executable or location 
/> echo $PATH

How to use it:
export PATH=$PATH:~/bin 
We will export the bin directory to the home directory
